/*
 * There are n boxes of balls in a row, every i-th box contains balls[i] balls.

A series of boxes is called Arithmetic, if it consists of at least three boxes
and if the difference between the number of balls in any two consecutive boxes 
is same.

A subset of boxes is called Arithmetic Subset,
if subset[i], subset[i+1], subset[i+2], ..., subset[j] is Arithmetic.

Your task is to findout the number of Arithmetic Subsets in the row of boxes.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1 : An integer N, number of boxes.
Line-2 : N space separated integers balls[i], i-th box contains balls[i] balls. 

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, number of Arithmetic Subsets.


Sample Input:
---------------
4
1 2 3 4

Sample Output:
----------------
3

Explanation:
------------
Arithmetic Subsets are: [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [1,2,3,4].


Sample Input:
---------------
5
1 3 5 7 9

Sample Output:
----------------
6

Explanation:
------------
Arithmetic Subsets are: [1,3,5], [3,5,7], [5,7,9], [1,3,5,7], [3,5,7,9], [1,3,5,7,9].
